    steps:
      # 📦 Step 1: Checkout your GitHub repo code
      - name: 📥 Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # ❗ Step 2: This is a placeholder for real kubectl access
      # 🛑 Minikube is local. So this won't work directly from GitHub yet.
      # ✅ In real-world use: you can add cloud kubeconfig here (for AWS, GKE, etc.)
